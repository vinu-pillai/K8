Here are some essential Kubernetes networking commands that can serve as a cheat sheet for managing and troubleshooting networking in Kubernetes:

Get information about pods and their IP addresses:
#kubectl get pods -o wide: List all pods with their IP addresses and other details.

Get information about services and their endpoints:
#kubectl get services: List all services in the cluster.
#kubectl describe service <service-name>: Get detailed information about a specific service, including its endpoints.

Test connectivity between pods or services:
#kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- <command>: Execute a command inside a pod to test connectivity to other pods or services.
#kubectl run -it --rm debug-pod --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh: Start a temporary debugging pod and access its shell to test network connectivity.

Check DNS resolution:
#kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>: Verify DNS resolution for a specific service inside a pod.

Create a Network Policy:
#kubectl apply -f <network-policy.yaml>: Apply a Network Policy defined in a YAML file to control pod-to-pod communication.

Describe Network Policy:
#kubectl describe networkpolicy <network-policy-name>: Get detailed information about a specific Network Policy.

View the network plugin status:
#kubectl get daemonsets kube-proxy -n kube-system: Check the status of the kube-proxy daemonset, which is responsible for network routing and load balancing.

Check cluster network configuration:
#kubectl cluster-info dump | grep -i "networking": View the cluster's networking configuration and check for any relevant information.

Troubleshoot connectivity issues:
#kubectl logs <pod-name>: View the logs of a pod to troubleshoot networking-related issues.
#kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>: View the logs of a specific container within a pod.

Test network connectivity with a specific port:
#kubectl run -it --rm testpod --image=busybox --restart=Never -- nc -zv <service-name> <port>: Test network connectivity to a specific port of a service using the netcat (nc) command.
